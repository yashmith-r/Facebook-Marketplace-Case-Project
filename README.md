# Facebook Marketplace Case Project

## Overview
This project analyzes Facebook Marketplace data to understand the impact of different post types on user engagement. The analysis involves handling categorical data, performing K-Means clustering, and visualizing the results to gain actionable insights into content strategy.

## Key Learnings

- **Handling Categorical Data:** Learned how to use One-Hot Encoding to convert categorical post types into numerical format, enabling the K-Means algorithm to process and cluster posts based on engagement metrics.
- **Standardizing Features:** Understood the importance of scaling numerical features to ensure all variables contribute equally to the clustering process, enhancing model accuracy.
- **K-Means Clustering:** Applied the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters and performed K-Means clustering to segment posts based on engagement metrics.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Used PCA for dimensionality reduction to visualize clusters in a 2D space, facilitating a clearer understanding of the data structure.
- **Engagement Metrics Analysis:** Analyzed how different post types impact reactions, comments, and shares, providing insights into effective content strategies.

## Experience Gained

- **Data Preprocessing:** Gained experience in handling categorical data and standardizing features for machine learning models.
- **Clustering Techniques:** Enhanced skills in applying and evaluating K-Means clustering, including using WCSS to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Learned to apply PCA for visualizing high-dimensional data and interpreting clustering results.
- **Visualization:** Created plots to visualize clusters and principal components, illustrating differences between post types and their engagement metrics.

## Analysis Highlights

1. **Impact of Post Types:** Evaluated the effect of different post types (photo, video, status, link) on user engagement metrics, with video posts showing the highest engagement.
2. **Cluster Visualization:** Used PCA to plot clusters, revealing patterns in how post types are grouped and their impact on engagement.
3. **Optimal Number of Clusters:** Applied the Elbow Method to identify the optimal number of clusters for K-Means, improving the segmentation of posts based on engagement data.
